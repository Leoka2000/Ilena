       <p>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</p>
        <li>
            See the portfolio section of my webpage to help you choose a style of tattoo that suits your tastes. You should let me know of which changes I should apply to your design.
        </li>
        <li>Please, double check your spam box when waiting for a response.</li>
        <li>Tattoos done by me are drawn in order of booking.</li>
        <li>Bookings are NOT finalized until a $50 deposit is made.</li>
        <li>Deposits are NON-REFUNDABLE as this is my only income!</li>
        <li>Please, do not book with me if you are fishing for a price. This is my craft and is what I do every single day, only book with an artist if you love their work. Good tattoos are not cheap and cheap tattoos are not good!</li>
        <li>Deposits can be transfered if you need to reschedule as long as enough notice is given.</li>
        <li>I have a schedule I try to stick to and being too late to the appointment will cause me to have to push back other clients appointments.</li>
        <li>Please, come fed and hydrated!</li>
        <li>Please, do not come under the effect of drugs or alcohol</li>
      </ul>
